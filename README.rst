gnome-shell-extension-transmission-daemon
=========================================

This is a Gnome Shell extension for monitoring a transmission-daemon or GTK app
using its RPC interface.

This extension supports Gnome Shell DE from version 3.4. Note that the latest
version on master may only support more recent versions (see
``./transmission-daemon@patapon.info/metadata.json``).

All credit for this project goes to the original author, Jean-Philippe Braun
(`@eonpatapon`_). This project was forked since maintainance has been abandoned.

Thanks as well to the many contributors who have contributed to this project --
see the `contributors graph`_ for a full list!

Installation
------------

Via extensions.gnome.org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visit the `GNOME Extensions Page`_.

Manual
~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/thekevjames/gnome-shell-extension-transmission-daemon.git
    $ cd gnome-shell-extension-transmission-daemon
    $ make install

If you have ``gnome-shell-devel`` installed, the extension will start working
immediately. If not, restart the shell (atf-f2, type "r") to enable it.

Older Versions of Gnome Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to find the correct version to install for support for older Gnome
Shell versions is to check the `GNOME Extensions Page`_ under the ``Versions``
header. All previously released versions should be accessible as zipfile
downloads there.

Some older versions have been tagged in this repo:

* the latest version supporting ``gnome-shell`` < 3.10 is tag 1.0.0
* the latest version supporting ``gnome-shell`` < 3.16 is tag 2.0.0
* the latest version supporting ``gnome-shell`` < 3.20 is tag 3.0.0

To install for those versions of ``gnome-shell``, please follow the manual
process outlined above after checking out one of the above tags.

Note that all versions since ``v20`` should have matching tags between this
repo and the `GNOME Extensions Page`_.

Configuration
-------------

You must enable the RPC interface in your transmission settings.

* for the GTK application, see preferences->remote.
* for ``transmission-daemon``, see ``/etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json``.
  Documentation for this file is on the `Transmission wiki`_.
